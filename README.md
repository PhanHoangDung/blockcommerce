<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features
Below are what BlockCommerce will provide for you:
- Contract: A smart library contract consists of a contract that creates, stores the NFT and a contract that serves its role as a marketplace for selling and exchanging NFTs. These contracts can be reused, secured and stored on blockchain, and are written by Solidity. Besides, all the functions are authorized according to the account's role. 
- Upgradable contract: A set of contract and tool is used for creating and managing contracts, it allows for the separation of upgradeable contracts on Ethereum.
- Lazy minting: Advanced feature, this helps the seller not to pay any fee from the time a product is created to the time it is sold. The fee in the end will be paid by the end user.
- Authorization: Advanced feature, this helps both the seller and buyer can controll the contract by themselves and execute it as they wished, instead of the inherent automatic execution of the contract.
